1. Performance Metrics
Net Profit (or P&L)
Total dollars (or ticks/points) gained or lost over the full test.

CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
Annualized rate of return, smoothing out compounding over the test period.

Total Return
Percentage gain (or loss) from start to finish.

Annualized Volatility
Standard deviation of returns, scaled to a year—to gauge how “bumpy” your equity curve was.

2. Risk Metrics
Max Drawdown
The largest peak-to-trough drop in your equity curve (in $, ticks, or %).

Drawdown Duration
How long it took (in days/bars) to recover from that max drawdown.

Sharpe Ratio
(Average return − risk-free rate) / volatility—measures return per unit of total risk.

Sortino Ratio
Similar to Sharpe but only penalizes downside volatility (i.e. “bad” moves).

Calmar Ratio
Annualized return / max drawdown—good for trend or swing systems.

Profit Factor
Gross profits ÷ gross losses—how many dollars you make for each dollar you lose.

Value at Risk (VaR)
Potential loss under normal market conditions, at a given confidence level (e.g. 95%).

3. Trade-Level Metrics
Win Rate
% of trades closed for a profit.

Average Win / Average Loss
Mean of profitable trades vs. mean of losing trades.

Expectancy
(Win Rate × Avg Win) − (Loss Rate × Avg Loss) — your average P&L per trade.

Max Consecutive Wins & Losses
Longest streaks—helps size risk appropriately.

Trade Count
Total number of trades—low counts can make metrics noisy.

Avg Bars per Trade (or Duration)
How long you typically stay in a trade.

4. Efficiency & Exposure
Annualized Turnover
Number of round-trips per year—helps estimate commissions/slippage impact.

Time in Market (or Exposure)
% of time your strategy has an open position—key for comparing “always-on” vs. “event-driven” systems.
